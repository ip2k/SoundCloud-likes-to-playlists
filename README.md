You'll need an app key and secret for this. Get that [here](http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new).

Put it all in a file called `oauth-details.yaml` in the same directory as this script.

Like this:

```
client_id: your-big-long-client-id
client_secret: impressively-large-client-secret
username: your-soundcloud-username
password_base64: base64'd version of your password
```
